# Hyman_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project

PROJECT SUMMARY
   My program for the project is going to be a matrix-vector operations program. I'm going to give the user the ability     to input and store mathematical vectors and n-by-n matricies in the code library. They will be stored in a Binary        Search Tree such that the ASCII code of the variable letter name of either the vector or matrix will define the value    of each node in the BST. Capital letter variables will repersent a matrix and lower case letter variables will           represent a vector. Then the user will be able to choose to perform an inner product between two vectors, a              vector-matrix multiplication, or a linear system solve using the conjugate gradient method with any of the vectors and    matricies that they input. Of coarse this will have to be given that the dimensions aggree for the matrix-vector         multiplication and that the linear system is solvable. The program will work by prompting the user to pick an option     diplayed on the menu when the program starts and everytime an operation ends.
   
HOW TO RUN
  I can include a makefile with my code. The user will just have be able to download all of the code files along with the   makefile in the same directory. Then they will need to use the make command in the terminal to easily compile and link   the whole program together and create the executable file.
   
DEPENDENCIES
  This program will have no dependencies. If anything, a little bit of knowledge in linear algebra.
  
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
  This program will only require to be ran on a machine that can compile and run c++ programs.
  
GROUP MEMBERS
  I am working on this project alone.
  
CONTRIBUTER
  Possibly TBD (depending on whether or not I rely on any).
